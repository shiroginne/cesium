Cesium
======

Cesium is a small cms-like plugin for rails applications.
It provides some functionality to create tree-based structure for your app and
generate navigation menus.

To install it use
 ruby script/plugin install

Cesium requires authlogic gem and awesome_nested_set plugin.
So, install it.
Then at the end of your routes.rb add:
 map.connect '*url', :controller => 'pages', :action => 'show'

After do:
 rake cesium:sync
it'll copy migration and some public files into ypur rails app directory.
And:
 rake db:migrate

Now you can add first user in rails console like that:
 User.new({:login => 'admin', :password => 'admin', :password_confirmation => 'admin', :admin => true, :email => 'admin@localhost.com'}).save!

Next step - http://localhost:3000/admin

Wellcome!
